### Local events
* *Mathematical Biology Research Group at Maxwell Institute* - co-organiser. The seminars are taking place biweekly during Semester 2 at the Maxwell Institute and mostly involve presentations from PhD students from the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University.
* *Website workshop for MAC-MIGS*, June 2023 - organiser. The purpose of the workshop was to introduce fellow PhD colleagues to building an academic website efficiently using GitHub Pages.
