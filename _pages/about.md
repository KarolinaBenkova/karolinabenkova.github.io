I'm a PhD candidate involved in the [MAC-MIGS CDT](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} at [Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} in Edinburgh, Scotland. My research concerns PDE-constrained optimization applied to problems in mathematical biology. My supervisors are [Mariya Ptashnyk](https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp91/){:target="_blank"} from Heriot-Watt University and [John Pearson](https://sites.google.com/site/johnpearsonmaths/home){:target="_blank"} from the University of Edinburgh.

Our recent work concerns parameter identification for a system of reaction-diffusion equations, which give rise to Turing patterns, using a fast solver. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14926)
